# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This mock server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project for the CGA project.

## Mock server demo
The implementation is automatically deployed to: https://cga-mock-server.herokuapp.com/v1

##Swagger UI interface
The Swagger UI interface can be found at: https://cga-mock-server.herokuapp.com/docs
Here, you will find our API and you can play around with our mock server doing some request

## API specification
The API specification can be accessed at: https://github.com/TrentoCrowdAI/cga-api-spec 



### Running the server locally
Change in api/swagger.yalm the host setting it to the localhost:8080

```
host: "localhost:8080"
```


To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```


To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open localhost:8080/docs/
```

The "try out!" feature in the docs site will not work with new api implemented locally because it will automatically add 'https' before localhost.


Instead, you can send a request to the API with a esplicit link, for example a GET request for all Data Collections is like localhost:8080/v1/dataCollections 


Otherwise, you can use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to send your requests in a more intuitive way and have a response with a better visualization
